# Edinburgh College - Codespace Bootcamp Course 2024

Edinburgh College's CodeSpace Bootcamp, in partnership with 2i Testing, offers a flexible and accessible bootcamp course that requires no prior computing degree, focusing instead on skill development and career readiness.

Over a condensed 7-week period, I have engaged in a project-driven curriculum, building a database-driven web application while learning key technologies, including:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* PHP
* SQL
* Cypress
<br/>

The following repository contains all my completed work for the course, as well as my final project, an e-commerce website built using all the technologies and languages I have learnt.
