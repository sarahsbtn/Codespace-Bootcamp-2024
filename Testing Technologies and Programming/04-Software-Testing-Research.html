    <h3>Activity - Research</h3>
    <div id="answers">
        In this activity you are required to research about the topics:<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li><b>What is Software Testing?</b></li>
            <p>Software testing is the process of checking the quality and functionality of software, and thus verifying if the software meets the expected requirements.
                Doing so allows for any errors and bugs to be highlighted and fixed which in turn improves the overall efficency, reliability and performance of the software.</p>
        
        
            <li><b>What are the dangers of releasing untested Software?</b></li>
            <p>Releasing untested software can pose a number of dangers, namely an increased risk of errors and bugs, flaws in security and performance issues. The repurcussions of such
                risks can lead to stability issues and security vulnerabilities, which in turn leads to poor user experience, thus affecting the overall reputation of the software company 
             and incurring financial losses due to needing to fix or recall released software.</p>
        
            <li><b>Types Of Software Testing:</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Functional Testing:</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>What is Functional Testing?</b></li>
                        <p>Functional testing is the process of verifying that the software meets its required specifications through
                            validating that its functions and applications work as expected.
                        </p>
                        <li><b>Give 3 examples.</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Unit testing - individual components of the software are tested to ensure the desired output is produced.</li>
                                <li>Integration testing - a set of individual components are tested to ensure they work together as expected once combined.</li>
                                <li>Smoke testing - the core and fundamental functionalities of the software are tested to ensure the most critial parts of the software work as intended.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Non-Functional Testing:</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>What is Non-Functional Testing?</b></li>
                        <p>Non-functional testing focuses on verifying if the performance, security, reliability and usability aspects
                            of the software are working as they should.  </p>
                        <li><b>Give 3 examples.</b></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Performance testing - asseses how efficently the software performs (speed, stability) under the required workload.</li>
                            <li>Security testing - checks to ensure the system is secure and protected from threats and attacks, from internal and external sources. </li>
                            <li>Load testing - tests the software behaviour under an increased workload to assess how well it can perform under such a load.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
